    <p>Hi there @{{ user.profile.name }},</p>

    <p>
      Your request to cancel your membership has been processed. You will be
      refunded for the time remaining. A separate invoice will be emailed to you
      with the details of the refund.

      As a reminder, any data such as images or videos that you have shared with
      your paid membership features will be retained. You will still have access
      to them but you may not be able to modify them or add new ones.

    <p>
      We hope you continue using Bottom Time at the free tier and, should you
      choose to reactive your paid membership in the future, we'll be here to
      welcome you! ❤️
