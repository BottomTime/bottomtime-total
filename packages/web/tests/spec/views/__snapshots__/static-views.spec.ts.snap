  <p>Howdy fellow developers,</p>
  <p>Wanna contribute to this project? Awesome! I could use the help! ‚ù§</p>
  <p><span> For those who want to contribute directly, you can checkout the source code </span><a class="space-x-1" href="https://github.com/BottomTime/bottomtime-total" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>from GitHub</span><span><i class="fa-solid fa-arrow-up-right-from-square"></i></span></a><span> . There is plenty of documentation in the README files to get started. </span></p>
  <p> I'm also <span class="italic">very</span> open to developers writing third party software to integrate this platform with the larger diver community! This platform is built on an API-first architecture, so you can build your own front-end, mobile app, or even a CLI tool to interact with the Bottom Time platform. I'm especially interested in importing dive logs from our user's dive computers as well as cataloguing dive sites and dive shops from around the world! Check out our <a href="https://docs.bottomti.me/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> API documentation </a> for more information. </p>
  <p> Thank you so much for taking an interest in my humble project! I look forward to working with each and every one of you! </p>
  <p>Happy coding and cheers! üçª</p>
